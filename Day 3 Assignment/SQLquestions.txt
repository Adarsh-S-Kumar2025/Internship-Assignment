CREATE TABLE: Creates an Employees table with columns for EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, and Salary.

	CREATE TABLE Employees (
		EmployeeID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
		FirstName VARCHAR(50),
		LastName VARCHAR(50),
		Department VARCHAR(100),
		Salary DECIMAL(10,2)
	);

INSERT: Adds three employee records to the table.

	INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)
	VALUES
	('Tom', 'Hanks', 'HR', 55000.00),
	('Jerry', 'Smith', 'IT', 65000.00),
	('Alice', 'Johnson', 'Finance', 72000.50);


SELECT: Shows different ways to query data:
Select all columns and rows

	SELECT * FROM Employees;


Select specific columns

	SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
	FROM Employees;

Select with a WHERE clause to filter results

What is the purpose of the IDENTITY keyword in the CREATE TABLE statement?

	In SQL Server, the IDENTITY keyword is used to make a column auto-increment 
	automatically whenever a new row is inserted.

Write a SELECT statement to retrieve only the FirstName and Salary of all employees.

	SELECT FirstName, Salary
	FROM Employees;

How would you modify the existing UPDATE statement to give all employees in the IT department a 10% raise

	UPDATE Employees
	SET Salary = Salary * 1.10
	WHERE Department = 'IT';


Write a SELECT statement to find the highest salary in the Employees table.

	SELECT MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary
	FROM Employees;

How would you add a new column named "HireDate" of type DATE to the Employees table?

	ALTER TABLE Employees
	ADD HireDate DATE;

Write an INSERT statement to add a new employee named "Sarah Brown" in the "Marketing" department with a salary of 72000.00.

	INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)
	VALUES ('Sarah', 'Brown', 'Marketing', 72000.00);

How would you modify the table to ensure that the Salary column cannot contain negative values?

	ALTER TABLE Employees
	ADD CONSTRAINT chk_Salary_Positive CHECK (Salary >= 0);

How would you add a UNIQUE constraint to the Employees table to ensure that no two employees can have the same email address

	ALTER TABLE Employees
	ADD Email VARCHAR(255);

	ALTER TABLE Employees
	ADD CONSTRAINT UQ_Employees_Email UNIQUE (Email);


Write an ALTER TABLE statement to add an "Email" column to the Employees table with a UNIQUE constraint that allows NULL values

	ALTER TABLE Employees
	ADD Email VARCHAR(255) NULL
	CONSTRAINT UQ_Employees_Email UNIQUE;
